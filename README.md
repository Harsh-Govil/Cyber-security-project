# Phishing Email Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect phishing emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to classify emails as either phishing or legitimate to help protect users from potential scams.

## Introduction

Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security. This project focuses on identifying phishing emails through a systematic approach, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled emails indicating whether each email is phishing or legitimate. The dataset is essential for training and testing the classification model.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Custom functions are developed to clean the email content by:

   - Converting text to lowercase
   - Removing URLs, hashtags, numbers, and punctuation
   - Ensuring standardization of terms to reduce redundancy

2. **Tokenization**: The cleaned text is split into individual tokens (words) for further analysis.

## Feature Extraction

We used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization to convert the tokenized text into numerical features. This approach emphasizes important terms relevant to phishing emails while diminishing the impact of commonly found words.

### Code Example

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

### Model Selection and Training

For this project, Logistic Regression is chosen as the classification algorithm due to its efficiency and interpretability. The model is trained on the TF-IDF matrix derived from the training dataset.

python:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

### Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the model, the following evaluation metrics were utilized:

Accuracy: Ratio of correctly classified emails to total emails tested.
Precision: True positives divided by total predicted positives.
Recall: True positives divided by actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results
The final evaluation showed that the model achieved an accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 92% and a recall of 90%. These results indicate the model's effectiveness in identifying phishing emails while maintaining a low false positive rate.

### Future Work

Future directions include:
Exploring more advanced classification models.
Implementing ensemble methods to enhance detection performance.
Conducting a more extensive hyperparameter tuning process
