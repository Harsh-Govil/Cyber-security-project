Phishing Email Detection Using Machine Learning
### Project Overview
This project is aimed at detecting phishing emails using machine learning algorithms. With the rise in online communication, phishing has become one of the major cybersecurity threats. This project uses textual data from emails to classify them as either phishing or legitimate using a combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models.

### Introduction
Phishing emails attempt to trick individuals into sharing sensitive information by pretending to be legitimate entities. This project leverages machine learning to automatically detect such malicious emails by analyzing their textual content. The end goal is to reduce human intervention by classifying emails as phishing or legitimate in real-time with high accuracy.

### Project Workflow
Data Collection: Gathering labeled email data from a reliable source.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the email content for feature extraction.
Feature Engineering: Using techniques like TF-IDF to transform raw text into numerical features.
Model Training: Training a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) on the preprocessed and feature-engineered dataset.
Evaluation: Using various metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
Deployment (optional): The model can be integrated into email filtering systems.
Dataset
The dataset contains labeled email samples categorized into phishing and legitimate emails. Each row in the dataset consists of an email body or subject and its corresponding label (0 for legitimate, 1 for phishing). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, which is well-suited for training supervised machine learning models.

Total Emails: ~50,000 emails (Phishing + Legitimate)
Features: Email content (text), labels (0 or 1)

### Preprocessing
The email text is messy, unstructured, and full of noise. Several preprocessing steps are performed to convert the raw text into a usable form for machine learning models:

Lowercasing: Converts all characters in the email to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
Removing Special Characters and Punctuation: Strips out any characters that are not alphanumeric to avoid unnecessary noise.
Removing Stopwords: Stopwords such as "and", "the", etc., are removed to reduce dimensionality without losing meaning.
Lemmatization: Converts words to their base forms (e.g., "running" becomes "run") to standardize terms.
Code Example (Text Preprocessing):
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import re

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Lowercasing
    text = text.lower()
    # Removing special characters and numbers
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    # Tokenization and stopword removal
    tokens = text.split()
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords.words('english')]
    # Lemmatization
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]
    return ' '.join(tokens)
### Feature Engineering
TF-IDF Vectorization:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features. This method helps highlight the most important words for classification while reducing the impact of frequent but unimportant words.

TF (Term Frequency): Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document.
IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Measures the importance of the term across the corpus.
Code Example (TF-IDF):
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)
Modeling
We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, but Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks like phishing detection. This model predicts the probability that an email belongs to either the phishing or legitimate class.

Model Training
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Training Data: Transformed using TF-IDF
Target Variable: Email Label (0 for legitimate, 1 for phishing)
Code Example (Logistic Regression):
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated the model using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: How many predicted phishing emails were actually phishing.
Recall: How many actual phishing emails were correctly identified.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Gives a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Code Example (Model Evaluation):
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1}")
Results
The Logistic Regression model performed well on the test dataset with the following results:

Accuracy: 95%
Precision: 92%
Recall: 90%
F1-Score: 91%
The model shows good performance, balancing the identification of phishing emails while minimizing false positives.

### Future Improvements
In future iterations of this project, we aim to:

Try Advanced Models: Experiment with more complex models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning methods like LSTM.
Ensemble Learning: Combine the outputs of multiple models to improve the overall accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform more extensive tuning of hyperparameters to improve model performance.
